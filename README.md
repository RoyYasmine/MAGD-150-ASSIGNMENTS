**Welcome to my page! I have included 5 projects that I have done in MAGD.**

# *Project 1*
In project 1, the goal was to create a black and white composition and the theme was outerspace. For this project, I chose to create an alien with a moon in the background.

# *Project 2*
In project 2, the goal was to create a color composition and the theme was ballons. For this project, I chose to create a rainbow hot air ballon that was soaring past some mountains during the night.

# *Project 3*
In project 3, the goal was to use math operations and the theme was bubbles. For this project, I chose to create a pig that was blowing bubble gum.

# *Project 6*
In project 6, the goal was to use organization and the theme was screensavers. For this project, I chose to create random colored cars that would move back and fourth across the screen at different speeds.

# *Project 7*
In project 7, the goal was to use transformations and the theme was nature. For this project, I chose to create different bugs at each corner of the screen and they all had a different function.
